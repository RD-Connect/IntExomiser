# IntExomiser 

# Run Exomiser

The client from the genomics platform sends a vcf file together with a json file for a specific donor that queries from the Phenotips.
The Exomiser web service receives the two files,parses the json in order to get the HPO terms and runs the 
exomiser algorithms with inputs the vcf file and the hpo terms. 

It stores the results in the "results" folder and renders the HTML Exomiser output to the genomics page.
